# üìâ Customer Churn Analysis ‚Äì Neo Telecom

## üß† Project Overview

**Domain**: Telecom | **Role**: Data Scientist | **Goal**: Predict and reduce customer churn

In this project, I take on the role of a Data Scientist at **Neo**, a telecom company that is facing significant customer churn ‚Äî the loss of clients to competing telecom providers. The objective is to analyze customer behavior, uncover patterns that lead to churn, and build a predictive model that can help proactively identify at-risk customers. This project leverages **data analysis**, **feature engineering**, **machine learning**, and **visualization** to generate actionable insights.

---

## üìÇ Dataset

The dataset contains historical information about Neo's customers, including:

* **Demographics**: gender, age group, etc.
* **Services**: type of phone/internet service, contract type, etc.
* **Billing and Payment**: monthly charges, payment method, tenure, etc.
* **Customer Status**: whether the customer has churned or not.

> The target variable is `Churn`, which indicates whether a customer has left the company (Yes) or not (No).

## üß∞ Tools and Technologies Used

* **Python**
* **Pandas & NumPy** ‚Äì data manipulation
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** ‚Äì data visualization
* **Scikit-learn** ‚Äì preprocessing, model building, and evaluation
* **Jupyter Notebook** ‚Äì interactive data science workflow

## üîç Steps Followed

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

* Checked for missing values and data types
* Analyzed the distribution of churn and non-churn customers
* Used visualizations to study relationships between features and churn

  * Eg: tenure vs churn, contract type vs churn, payment method vs churn

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**

* Converted categorical variables using label encoding and one-hot encoding
* Handled class imbalance if needed (e.g., using `SMOTE`)
* Standardized or normalized continuous variables
* Feature selection using correlation and domain knowledge

### 3. **Model Building**

* Trained and tested multiple machine learning models:

  * Logistic Regression
  * Decision Tree Classifier
  * Random Forest
  * Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* Used **train-test split** and **cross-validation** for robust performance evaluation

### 4. **Model Evaluation**

* Used metrics like:

  * Accuracy
  * Precision
  * Recall
  * F1 Score
  * Confusion Matrix
* Compared performance to select the best model

### 5. **Insights & Recommendations**

* Identified key churn-driving factors:

  * Month-to-month contracts
  * High monthly charges
  * Electronic check payment method
* Recommended actionable strategies:

  * Offer discounts or loyalty benefits to short-tenure users
  * Promote long-term contracts with better benefits
  * Improve billing transparency and customer service

---

## ‚úÖ Outcome

* Successfully identified the key factors influencing churn.
* Built a predictive model with decent accuracy to flag potential churners.
* Provided strategic business recommendations to improve customer retention.

---

## üìå Key Learnings

* Importance of EDA and visualization in understanding churn behavior
* How contract and billing type significantly impact customer loyalty
* Hands-on experience with building classification models and interpreting results

---

## üìä Future Work

* Deploy the model using Flask or Streamlit
* Integrate with real-time dashboards for business use
* Explore deep learning models or ensemble stacking for improved accuracy
